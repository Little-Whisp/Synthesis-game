                Synthesis is a game about a post apocalyptic world. You are Didi a robot that is on a mission to rebuild the world. You can explore different area's with
                different season's. In these areas you also have different flora. Because of radiation there is no more life on earth.
            </p><p>
            You have to explore these different area's to collect seeds, with these seeds you can plant trees, flowers and other flora to rebuild the earth and make it
            habitable for humans and animals. But beware, other creature's may lurk in these area's and will attack you if you come to close. Death will lead to you respawning to a checkpoint
            and loosing your collected seeds. If you leave these seeds in the wrong area for to long they will bloom into monsters that you will have to fight in order to reclaim these seeds.

                We wanted to have a very simplistic yet pretty visual art for our game mostly because it would give is more freedom with designing the character and world.
                Most pixel games keep their art style simple which give them the opportunity to less spend time on creating pretty art and more time to refine their art.
                For our backgrounds for each season we want to use a colour pallet that has 3 shades of the same colour. The further something is the lighter
                the colour, the closer something is the darker the colour.

            </p><p>

            We made this game to learn children about biodiversity, plants and the importance of the enviroment.
            Climate change could lead to a similar world like in the game. It's important
            that young kids learn how to take care of our planet, so they can live and create
            a healthy world for their generation. We want to achieve this by also giving
            small facts about the plants you collect. As you explore each area you will also
            learn about what animal life lives there and what plants grow there.
